# backend-vet

This part of my full stack is the backend side where i have my APIs and connection to my Mongo database. The controller file in the api folder are
the methods that get the data from the frontend side of the application and pass it on to the DAO (data access object) methods. The DAO file is where the methods 
to contact the mongo database are at. The main goal for this project was to learn how to use the basic CRUD methods to a database hence the frontend was made 
in a quick and simple fasion.
